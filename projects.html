											<br>
											<p>Laravel 5.6: Migrations, MVC, Query Builder, PHP, MySQL, HTML, CSS, JS, jQuery, Ajax, Actionscript rehaul
											</p>
											<br>
											<p>Hydra is an accounting application used to investigate records from different account types (MBS vs PS accounts)
												for discrepancies in balance. The user can update account matching between these different types of accounts
												(which MBS accounts correspond to which PS accounts). Users may upload files for each month for each account
												type and the application takes care of matching up various transactions and computing the difference for
												corresponding accounts. If adjustments need to be made to balance out accounts, the user may make an adjustment.
												 That adjustment is recorded so there is a convenient history of the change.
											</p>
											<br>
											<p>Hydra follows an MVC & RESTful architecture.
												Ajax requests were employed to create a more desktop-application-like experience.
												The data table generation features column sorting, visible column selection and exporting for use in Excel.

											<br>
											<p>Role-based Authorization, PHP, MySQL, HTML, CSS, JS, jQuery, Ajax
											</p>
											<br>
											<p>Gone are the days of using Google Sheets and a “catch-all” notes column for
												creating, tracking, and managing orders. This application was used by a bookstore to track orders
												for needed textbooks which were not already on file as a course material for a given course.
												The user may store pending new course materials to be added to the next update.
												Orders can be displayed and their status can be updated throughout the ordering
												process with each step being documented. Buyers, who manage course materials associated
												with departments specific to them, can use special filters for tracking their orders.
											</p>
											<br>
											<p>This project features role based authorization and an idle time log out.
												The order management page features various sorting and searching functionalities
												for sifting through orders. The original course material lookup logic was rehauled
												with an Ajax solution that greatly increased speed over the old solution.
												A lot of development occurred in the area of communicating with different departments and analyzing user needs.

											<br>
											<p>Experience with Users/ Use Cases/ User Reactions, PHP, MySQL, HTML, CSS, JS, jQuery
											</p>
											<br>
											<p>This graduation form is a customer-facing regalia ordering service, designed to streamline the regalia
												selection process and reduce wait times. Customers can fill out the order application and then take their
												order printout to third-party merchandise vendors in another location in the building.
											</p>
											<br>
											<p>The admin side of the application allows admin users to look up and reprint orders as needed.
												Admin can also update product availability, description and price on the fly if necessary.
												On the customer side, a step-by-step process was developed and input validations were of course employed.
												This product was really useful in understanding customer reactions and tendencies to safeguard against.

											<br>
											<p>PHP Mailer, .ical file formatting, File Attachments, JS, jQuery, Ajax, Recaptcha
											</p>
											<br>
											<p>The Community Center Scheduler is a service developed for a third-party customer
												to facilitate organized reservations for two different community centers (East and West).
												This new system replaces their old paper system.
											</p>
											<br>
											<p>This project utilizes PHP Mailer, .ical formatting, and emailed reservation confirmation with file attachments.
												Custom JS was written for time selection using Ajax requests to fetch already reserved times.
												This script also accounted for specific needs of the customer such as adjusting available times
												depending on the day, allowing for a certain gap between reservations, and other courtesies for the key handler’s convenience.
